__Huffman Coding Project__  
  The Huffman Coding Project is a comprehensive implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm in [programming language]. This project provides several features that allow you to effectively compress and decompress data using Huffman coding. Here are the key features of the project:

__1. Encoding__  
The project includes a robust encoding functionality that enables you to compress a given input file using Huffman coding. By executing the encode.js script with appropriate parameters, you can generate a compressed output file containing the encoded data. This feature utilizes the frequency-based approach of Huffman coding to assign shorter codes to more frequently occurring characters or symbols, resulting in efficient compression.  

__2. Decoding__  
The decoding feature allows you to decompress a file that has been compressed using Huffman coding. By running the decode.js script and specifying the path to the compressed input file, you can retrieve the original data in a decompressed format. This feature utilizes the generated Huffman codes and the encoded data to reconstruct the original information accurately.
